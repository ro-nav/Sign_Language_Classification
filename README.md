# Sign Language Classification ðŸ“· ðŸš€

## Introduction
Speech-impaired individuals use hand signs and gestures to communicate. However, understanding their language can be challenging for those who are not familiar with it. This project aims to develop a system that recognizes different signs and gestures, facilitating communication for both speech-impaired and normal individuals.

### Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a convolutional deep learning neural network for the classification of sign language images.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of images of various hand signs and gestures. Each image is labeled with the corresponding sign or gesture.

### Problem Type
This project addresses a multiclass classification problem.

## Introduction

In this project, we aim to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of American Sign Language (ASL) alphabets and numbers. The CNN model is trained on a dataset consisting of hand sign images, and its performance is evaluated on unseen test data.

## Data Description

The dataset contains a collection of images representing alphabets from the American Sign Language (ASL). It consists of 2515 images with dimensions of 400x400 pixels. The dataset is organized into 36 folders, each representing a different class (0-9, A-Z).

## Loading Libraries

The necessary libraries for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation are imported in this section.

## Data Extraction

In this section, the images are extracted from the dataset folders, and a DataFrame is created to store filenames and corresponding categories.

## Data Exploration

Data exploration is conducted to visualize a few images from the dataset and understand the distribution of classes.

## Train Test Split

The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets to train and evaluate the model.

## Data Preparation

Data preparation involves preprocessing and augmenting the image data using the ImageDataGenerator class.

## Deep Learning Model

The CNN model architecture, consisting of convolutional layers, pooling layers, dropout layers, and fully connected layers, is developed in this section.

## Evaluation

The performance of the trained model is evaluated on both the training and validation datasets.

### Training and Validation Accuracy
